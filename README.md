# web

Website for the NPT Scotland Project.

To reproduce the website locally, clone the repository, e.g. with the following command (assuming you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed):

```bash
gh repo clone nptscot/nptscot.github.io
```

The easiest way to get a live version of the website going for many people will be with VS Code.
Install VS Code, and then install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

Open the folder in VS Code, and then click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of the window.
You should see something like the following (note that live server will be running on port 5500 and the local version updates automatically when you save changes to the files):
